##How to set this up:
1. in your terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory and run `npm install`
2. Run the command `node server.js`
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Enter Text in to see the the statistics for the entry.

##Cool features I'd have like to have added:
I wanted to figure out how to find words that rhyme with each other. I think it would have been cool to make a single page app to keep track of how much a poem flowed.The way I would approach this problem is by finding the last word in the line and comparing them against each other to find a rhyme scheme. My concern was the readably and the edge cases that exist in the english language. I also wanted to implement hangman on a random word below!

##Challenges
I was trying to pattern match 4Â°C to detect this as a word. My count is offset by 1 because of this.Bigram detection was difficult for me. I wanted to have a better solution to what I provided. I really look forward to discussing this. With my solution to finding a language there were too many edge cases and couldn't deal with them any simple then what I had. I only did Italian, English, and French.

##Final Thoughts
 I think this exercise was really fun and its helped me understand a lot about word processing. I used regex in ways I haven't before.
